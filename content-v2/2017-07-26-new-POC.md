A while ago, I started using Pelican to offer a new documentation system for YunoHost. I mixed real content with demonstration content, which made the result difficult to understand and hack with.

Here is a new version: [**access documentation**]({filename}/pages/docs.md)

Please read the [Simon's Readme](https://github.com/Jibec/Simon/tree/refonte), careful, I'm using a branch named *refonte*.
