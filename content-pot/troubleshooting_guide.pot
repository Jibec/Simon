"## General notes ### Do not break YunoHost Best way to troubleshoot is to "
"not have to troubleshoot because you have tested everything before deploying "
"it on your server.  This means that everytime you want to try a new thing "
"(non-official app, new specific config, package an app...), you should try "
"it on a development or testing instance, *not* on your production "
"server. For this, you can [set up a Vagrant box](vagrant), or for instance a "
"[DigitalOcean droplet](install_on_vps) for 1 cent/hour."

"### Use non-official apps with caution While it's tempting to install every "

"read at least part of the package source code. Install, remove and upgrade "
"script should be present.  Keep in mind that when you install an app, you "

"packaging are excellent and others can break some part of your YunoHost "
