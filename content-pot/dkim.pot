"##### Note: * This is the 2nd revision of this Work In Progress How-To "
"activate [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) "
"and [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) in "
"YunoHost.  * Le DKIM and SPF prevent emails which could be sent with your "
"domain name from a non legitim server. This avoid spam.  * Untill, this is "
"not natively integrated in YunoHost core, it will mean to that Postfix "
"configuration will be blocked (or each time there is a change some "
"configuration lines will need to be added to the end of "
"`/etc/postfix/main.cf`).  * To be fully functionnal DKIM requires a "
"modification of your [DNS zone](/dns_config_en), which propagantion can take "
"up to 24h."
