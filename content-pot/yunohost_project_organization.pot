"This document aims at allowing contributors to feel legitimate in "
"contributing to the YunoHost project together with collective feedback.  The "
"project is community-based and hasty decisions made by a restricted group of "
"contributors can generate frustrations at a later stage.  To address this "
"issue, the proposed solution here is to ensure that decisions are taken "
"collectively and that they are sufficiently thought out.  An advisory "
"council provides orientations for the evolution of the YunoHost project and "
"special interest groups allow more efficient contribution in relation to "
"each specific topic."

"scith, ju), a decision was made to organise work by special interest groups, "
