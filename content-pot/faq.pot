"#### Why can I access to applications via the IP address? The "
"[SSO](https://github.com/Kloadut/SSOwat/) does not allow access to the user "
"part (apps included) via an IP address. For this purpose, you should use a "
"domain name. One trick could be to modify the [`hosts` file (last "
"ยง)](dns_local_network_en) of your desktop computer with a domain name that "
"you don't need to own."
