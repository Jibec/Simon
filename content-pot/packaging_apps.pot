"* install script must contain support in case of script errors to delete "
"residuals files thanks to `set -e` and [trap](packaging_apps_trap_fr); * "
"install script should use the command-line method instead of calls to curl "
"through web install form; * install script should save install answers; * "
"application sources should be checked with a control sum (sha256, sha1 or "
"md5) or a PGP signature; * scripts should be tested on Debian Jessie as well "
"as 32 bits, 64 bits and ARM architectures; * backup and restore scripts "
"should be present and functional."
