Better error handling (errno, errstr)

** TransTractor.pm
 - process(): $self->addendum($file) || die "An addendum failed\n";
 - poheader()

 >> +$parser->{TT}{utf_mode} = 1;
 >> +$parser->{TT}{file_in_charset} = $mastchar;
 > What about a function in transtractor allowing to set the mastchar ? I'd

** po-debconf:
 - change the pot header as documented in po4a(7) 

** Po.pm
 - close filehandle in write (and same in TransTractor.pm).
 - verbose => type in automatic comments

** Sgml.pm
 - get ride of nsgml
 - move the tag lists to an external file

** Man.pm: 
 - handle .ce (11 pages need it)
   >>>
   Text lines can be centered by using the ce' request.  The line
   after `ce' is centered (horizontally) on the page.  To center more than
   one line, use `.ce N' (where N is the number of lines to center),
   followed by the N lines.  To center many lines without counting them,
   type:
   
        .ce 1000
	lines to center
	.ce 0
		  
   The .ce 0' request tells groff' to center zero more lines, in other
   words, stop centering.
   <<<
   The problem is that the number of lines may change during the
   translation...
 - same story about .ul N (underline N lines)
