"Testing can only prove the presence of bugs"
  -- Dijkstra

I try to add a test for each bug found in po4a in order to ensure that
they won't surface again.

If the test suite reports errors, please join enough details so that I can
fix them. At least, provide me the detailed result of the test suite. For
that, run the following command:

  ./Build test

It will produce output to your screen containing most of the details I
need. Please also report all details you think appropriate.

Thanks, Mt.
