			po4a-build - one-stop translation
			=================================

po4a allows translations to be merged into the source documents for
the generation of translated content but does not then go on to prepare
the translated output documents - typically the XML is translated but
no translated manpage is built.

The main reason is that the system to prepare that translated manpage
can be build-specific.

po4a-build is an attempt to provide a one-stop method for building both
translated and untranslated content *and* putting that content into the
final installation locations in a simple and flexible manner.

Other files
===========

Packages wanting to use po4a-build often are not using autotools but
may be using just make. po4a-build has example files that can support
adding program output translation and these files can be made available
via po4a. Files include a Makefile suitable for use in the top level
po/ directory, to build, maintain and install translations of the
files described in po/POTFILES.in using variables defined in the
Makevars file, of which po4a-build provides two examples. (More to be
added, as necessary.)
